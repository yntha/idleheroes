# Idle Heroes Client

A Python client for interacting with the Idle Heroes game using an account of your choice.

## Usage
This client is designed to be used as a library in your own Python scripts, but it also provides a command-line interface (CLI) for basic operations:
```bash
# installation
python -m pip install --user -U https://github.com/yntha/idleheroes.git

# run
ih-client
```

The client is still a work in progress, and more features will be added over time. For now all it does is send echo requests to the server to demonstrate connectivity.
